# branches:

- master: Using \<Routes\> and \<Route\> to plan the route.
- useRoutesHookRouting: Using "useRoutes" hook to plan the route. Pro is that the route can be written in a JavaScirpt Object. Maybe moved out from App.js to a separate file?
- customHookForWindowSize: Basic from master, added the custom hook for detect the window size, for responsive design?
